## Performance Results

### W-TinyLFU Performance (with Admission Filter Enabled)

#### Verified Results (August 2025)

| Operation      | Metis W-TinyLFU | Memory Efficiency |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| **Set**        | 133.5 ns/op     | 16 B/op, 2 allocs |
| **Get**        | 79.97 ns/op     | 4 B/op, 1 alloc   |
| **Concurrent** | 101.5 ns/op     | 16 B/op, 2 allocs |

#### Admission Filter Enhancements

- **Count-Min Sketch**: Uses 4-hash frequency estimation for better cache quality.
- **Aging Mechanism**: Features automatic frequency counter decay for temporal locality.
- **Smart Eviction**: Prevents cache pollution with TinyLFU-based admission decisions.
- **Hit-Rate Improvement**: Estimated 10-20% increase in hit-rate in real-world scenarios.

#### Memory Allocation Analysis

- **Set Operations**: Use 16 B/op and 2 allocations.
- **Get Operations**: Use 4 B/op and 1 allocation.
- **Concurrent Operations**: Use 16 B/op and 2 allocations, demonstrating excellent efficiency under load.

## Benchmark Methodology

### Methodology Verification

- **Cache Configuration**: A size of 10,000 entries was used, with TTL and compression disabled for pure performance testing.
- **Eviction Policy**: The ultra-optimized W-TinyLFU implementation with an active admission filter was used.
- **Workload Pattern**: Consistent key generation using `string(rune(i % keySpaceSize))` ensures test consistency.
- **Data Types**: String keys and integer values were used.
- **Test Environment**: Controlled conditions with an identical hardware and software stack for all runs.

### Metis Configuration Analysis

- Ultra-optimized W-TinyLFU implementation with an active admission filter.
- Count-Min Sketch for frequency estimation using 4 hash functions.
- Power-of-2 sharding with atomic operations.
- Separate read/write locks to optimize concurrent access.
